### Modules 4-6 (Days 41-120)
**Status**: Placeholder content - These modules maintain educational structure but need real videos when available

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Document created with complete curriculum structure
2. 🔄 Update script ready to integrate 69 found videos
3. 🔄 Resume script to continue search when quota resets

### Tomorrow's Tasks (When API Quota Resets)
1. Run `youtube-search-resume.js` to continue from Day 21
2. Focus on finding UV mapping and texturing videos (Days 21-30)
3. Search for rigging and animation content (Days 31-40)
4. Continue through remaining modules as quota allows

### Integration Progress
- **Days 1-20**: Partially complete (69 videos found)
- **Days 21-40**: Pending search (quota exceeded)
- **Days 41-120**: Placeholder structure maintained

## Found Videos Summary by Creator

### High-Value Creators (Multiple Videos Found)
- **ByteBlox**: 5 videos
- **AlvinBlox**: 4 videos
- **Grant Abbitt**: 4 videos
- **Joey Carlino**: 5 videos
- **SouthernShotty**: 3 videos
- **CGDive**: 3 videos
- **BrawlDev**: 3 videos
- **Blender Guru**: 2 videos
- **Captain Creativity**: 2 videos
- **Imphenzia**: 2 videos

### Videos Needing Replacement
Several found videos don't match the intended content:
- Angular tutorial instead of Roblox properties
- Car service guide instead of material service
- Mosque architecture instead of building techniques
- Environmental effects of coronavirus instead of game water effects
- Pokemon storage instead of naming conventions
- Power BI instead of model hierarchy
- And others...

## Technical Notes

### API Quota Management
- YouTube Data API v3 quota: 10,000 units/day
- Search operation: ~100 units per request
- Approximate searches possible: 100/day
- Current status: Quota exceeded after ~100 searches

### File Outputs
- `youtube-videos-found-2025-08-24T16-43-09-909Z.json` - All found videos
- `curriculum-update-2025-08-24T16-43-09-909Z.json` - Update mapping
- `youtube-search-report-2025-08-24T16-43-09-909Z.md` - Human-readable report
- `youtube-search-checkpoint.json` - Progress tracking (to be created)

### Resume Strategy
The resume script will:
1. Load the checkpoint file to see completed searches
2. Skip already-searched videos
3. Continue from the last unsuccessful search
4. Save progress after each batch
5. Gracefully handle quota errors
6. Provide clear instructions for continuation

## Quality Metrics

### Content Alignment
