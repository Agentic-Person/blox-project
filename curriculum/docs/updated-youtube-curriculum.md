## YouTube Infrastructure Organization (January 2025)

### Technical Implementation Reorganization

**Background**: The project previously had YouTube-related files scattered across multiple locations, making maintenance difficult and creating code duplication.

**Reorganization Completed**: All YouTube functionality has been centralized into `src/lib/youtube/` with the following structure:

```
src/lib/youtube/
├── api/
│   ├── types.ts              # Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
│   ├── youtube-data-api.ts   # YouTube Data API v3 integration
│   └── youtube-player-api.ts # YouTube IFrame Player API wrapper
├── scripts/
│   ├── README.md             # Script documentation and usage
│   ├── curriculum-alignment/ # Curriculum management scripts
│   ├── playlist-import/      # Bulk video import utilities
│   └── video-validation/     # Content health check tools
├── utils/
│   ├── duration-formatter.ts # ISO 8601 duration parsing (PT39M33S → MM:SS)
│   ├── id-extractor.ts      # YouTube URL/ID validation and extraction
│   └── playlist-parser.ts    # Playlist metadata extraction
└── index.ts                  # Main export file with organized exports
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Eliminated Code Duplication**
   - Centralized duration formatting across 20+ scripts
   - Unified YouTube ID extraction logic
   - Shared TypeScript type definitions

2. **Enhanced Curriculum Management**
   - Playlist import tools for bulk video addition
   - Automated video validation and health checks
   - Curriculum alignment verification scripts

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Clear import paths: `@/lib/youtube/api/youtube-data-api`
   - Comprehensive TypeScript support
   - Organized documentation and examples

### Scripts Relocated and Updated

**From `scripts/curriculum-tools/` and `scripts/`:**
- `youtube-api-video-replacer.js` → `src/lib/youtube/scripts/curriculum-alignment/`
- `update-youtube-videos-*.js` → `src/lib/youtube/scripts/playlist-import/`
- `verify-curriculum.js` → `src/lib/youtube/scripts/video-validation/`
- All relative paths updated for new location

### Usage for Curriculum Updates

**Adding New Videos:**
```bash
# Use centralized playlist import
node src/lib/youtube/scripts/playlist-import/playlist-to-curriculum.js

# Validate curriculum integrity
node src/lib/youtube/scripts/video-validation/verify-curriculum.js
```

**Video Health Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check video availability
node src/lib/youtube/scripts/video-validation/content-health-check.js
```

### Breaking Changes Resolved

- Fixed TypeScript export conflicts (`PlayerState`, `formatDuration`)
- Updated component imports to use centralized utilities
- Resolved AI Journey store naming conflicts (`forceShowWelcomeOverlay`)

**Migration Impact**: No changes required for existing curriculum content. All video URLs and metadata remain intact.
