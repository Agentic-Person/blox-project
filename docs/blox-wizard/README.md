## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why Not N8n Workflows?

**Decision**: Build Chat Wizard directly in Next.js instead of using N8n workflows

**Rationale**:
- No need for Discord bot automation (primary N8n use case)
- Content health checks not a priority
- Direct implementation provides better control and debugging
- Reduces system complexity and external dependencies
- Easier maintenance and development workflow

### Why PostgreSQL + pgvector vs Pinecone?

**Decision**: Use Supabase's built-in pgvector instead of Pinecone

**Rationale**:
- Already using PostgreSQL for other application data
- Single database reduces operational complexity
- pgvector is free and performant for our scale (< 10K videos)
- Native SQL integration allows complex queries combining vector and relational data
- Easier backup and disaster recovery

### Why GPT-4o-mini vs GPT-4?

**Decision**: Use GPT-4o-mini for response generation

**Rationale**:
- 50x cost reduction compared to GPT-4
- Sufficient quality for educational Q&A with transcript context
- Faster response times (< 2 seconds vs 5-10 seconds)
- Better rate limiting characteristics
- Smart caching further reduces costs

---

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **User Queries**: Stored with user consent for learning optimization
- **API Keys**: Secured using environment variables and Vercel secrets
- **Database Access**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforced
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user limits to prevent abuse

### Content Safety
- **Educational Focus**: AI responses limited to educational content
- **Content Filtering**: Inappropriate content detection and filtering
- **Age Appropriate**: Responses tailored for 10-25 year old audience
- **Citation Required**: All responses must cite source material

### Privacy Compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Only store necessary user interaction data
- **Anonymization**: Usage patterns anonymized for analytics
- **GDPR Ready**: User data deletion and export capabilities
- **Audit Logging**: Security events logged for compliance

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Track

#### Performance Metrics
- API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Database query performance
- Cache hit rates by question type
- OpenAI token usage and costs

#### Business Metrics
- Daily active chat users
- Question categories and trends
- Video reference patterns
- Learning path completion rates

#### System Health
- Database connection pool usage
- Memory usage patterns
- Error rates by endpoint
- External API availability

### Alerting Strategy

| Alert Type | Threshold | Action |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| **High Response Time** | > 5 seconds | Investigate performance bottlenecks |
| **Low Cache Hit Rate** | < 50% | Review caching strategy |
| **High Error Rate** | > 5% | Check external API status |
| **Token Usage Spike** | > 150% of baseline | Review for abuse or system issues |
