## Critical Path Analysis

### Must Complete in Order:
1. **01-01** → **01-02** → **01-03** → **01-04** (core functionality chain)
2. **01-05** depends on **01-04** (UI needs working API)
3. **02-01** depends on **01-04** (caching needs API structure)
4. **03-01** depends on **02-01** (calendar needs fast responses)
5. **04-01** depends on **03-05** (optimization needs complete features)

### Parallel Work Opportunities:
- **Phase 3A** (Calendar/Todo) can run **completely parallel** to **Phase 1** (Video Search)
- **03A-01** through **03A-05** have minimal dependencies on Phase 1 completion
- **01-06** (testing) can run parallel with **01-04**, **01-05**
- **01-07** (documentation) can run parallel with most Phase 1 tasks
- **02-02** through **02-06** can run partially in parallel
- **03-02** through **03-05** can run partially in parallel

### New Parallel Development Strategy:
- **Team A**: Focus on **01-01** → **01-04** (Video Search & Transcripts)
- **Team B**: Focus on **03A-01** → **03A-05** (Calendar/Todo System)
- **Integration Point**: Both teams coordinate on Chat API structure in **01-04**
