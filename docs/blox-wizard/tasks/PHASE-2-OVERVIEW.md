## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Areas:
1. **Cache Complexity**: 3-tier caching can be complex to debug
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing, clear cache invalidation rules
2. **Memory Usage**: Large cache sizes may impact performance
   - *Mitigation*: LRU eviction, memory monitoring, size limits
3. **Cache Consistency**: Stale cache entries could provide outdated answers
   - *Mitigation*: Automatic expiration, cache versioning

### Medium Risk Areas:
1. **Pattern Detection Accuracy**: False positives/negatives in question matching
   - *Mitigation*: Tunable similarity thresholds, manual review tools
2. **Token Optimization**: Over-optimization might hurt response quality
   - *Mitigation*: A/B testing, quality metrics monitoring
