# ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY ⚠️

## This Directory Contains the ONLY Working Video Configuration

### What's Here:
- **WORKING_CURRICULUM_151_VIDEOS.json** - The ACTUAL working YouTube videos from 3 days of API work
  - Contains 151 REAL YouTube video IDs that were tested and working
  - Created: August 26, 2025, 11:25 AM
  - This is the result of ~400 YouTube API calls over 3 days

### Why This Exists:
After 3 days of YouTube API work to find and validate 151 working videos, a destructive script (`restructure-curriculum.js`) replaced all the real YouTube IDs with fake/placeholder IDs from a master document, destroying all our work.

### Known Working Videos Include:
- TPrnSACiTJ4 - Blender Guru's Donut Tutorial (VERIFIED WORKING)
- Q7AOvWpIVHU - Imphenzia's 10-minute modeling (VERIFIED WORKING)
- 9MUgLaF22Yo - BrawlDev's Roblox Studio Basics (VERIFIED WORKING)
- XY6Ig48tAnk - AlvinBlox's Tycoon Tutorial (VERIFIED WORKING)
- Plus ~147 other verified working videos

### TO RESTORE:
Run: `node scripts/restore-from-protected.js`

### DO NOT:
- Run `restructure-curriculum.js` - This DESTROYS real videos
- Manually edit these files
- Delete this directory
- Trust any script that claims to "fix" or "restructure" without checking

### ALWAYS:
- Create backups before ANY curriculum changes
- Test videos after ANY modifications
- Check this directory if videos stop working
