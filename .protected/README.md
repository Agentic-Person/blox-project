### PROPER_CURRICULUM_STRUCTURE.json
- **Created**: August 27, 2025
- **Description**: Correct curriculum structure with proper titles, creators, and metadata
- **Videos Status**:
  - ‚úÖ 1 verified working video (BrawlDev tutorial)
  - ‚úÖ 2 Blender videos already correct (Blender Guru, Imphenzia)

  - üîç 145 videos with unverified IDs

### Key Points:
1. The curriculum STRUCTURE is correct - all titles, creators, and organization
2. We only need to find/verify real YouTube IDs
3. DO NOT randomly insert videos - each has a specific place
4. The master document contains FAKE YouTube IDs - don't use them
